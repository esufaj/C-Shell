# **C-Shell**

A C program which serves as a shell interface that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a seperate process. My implementation supports input and output redirection, as well as pipes as a form of IPC between pairs of commands. Some system calls used in implementation are
fork(), execvp(), wait(), dup2(), and pipe().

The shell interface gives the user a prompt 'mysh:~$' after which the next command is entered by the user.

The functionalities of the shell which can be used are:
1) '!!' - which is a history feature to allow the user to execute the most recent command entered. For example, if a user enters the command ls -l, they can then execute that command again by entering !! at the prompt. Any command executed in this fashion should be echoed on the userâ€™s screen, and the command should also be placed in the history buffer as the next command. Your

2) '<' or '>' - which are the redirection operators where > redirects the output of a command to a file and < redirects the input to a command from a file.  For example, if a user enters mysh:~$ ls > outFile.txt the output from the ls command will be redirected to the file outFile.txt. Similarly, input can be redirected as well. 

3) '|' - The pipe operator allows the output of one command to serve as input to another command. For example, the following command sequence mysh:~$ ls -l | less has the output of the command ls -l serve as the input to the less command. Both the ls and less commands will run as separate processes and will communicate using the UNIX pipe() function.

### HOW TO RUN:

step 1: (to go to program location) cd to working directory
step 2: (to compile program) gcc shellfinal.c -o shellfinal
step 3: (to run program) ./shellfinal
step 4: use implemented commands in the shell such as : <, >, |, !!, cd etc
